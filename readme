Quantum Halo Toy Model

Simple Jupyter notebook to test if galaxy halos could be neutral hydrogen in high-n quantum superposition (no dark matter required).

Inspired by Alan Ernest’s 2001 arXiv paper: Dark Matter and Galactic Halos - A Quantum Approach

Features:

•  Input: pick any NGC galaxy from dropdown (or type your own)

•  Tweak: principal quantum number n, coherence scale

•  Output: rotation curve, surface density profile (1/r²), mock halo image

•  Compare to real data—see if quantum hydrogen fits flat curves

Run in Colab or locally. No physics degree needed—just click and watch.

If it works… maybe JWST halo spectra are just superposed hydrogen. If not… still cool to play with.

PRs welcome. Let’s see if this holds up.# Quantum Hydrogen Superposition Halo Toy Model
